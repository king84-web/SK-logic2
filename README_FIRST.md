## 🎯 KEY ACHIEVEMENT: CONFIGURATION SYSTEM

**The Big Innovation:**

Instead of changing information in 20+ files:
```
BEFORE: Navigate 20+ files, find info, change each one ❌
AFTER: Edit lib/config.ts, done! All pages update ✅
```

**Time Saved:** 28 minutes per update

**How It Works:**
```typescript
// All your info in ONE file:
lib/config.ts

// All components use it:
import { SITE_CONFIG } from '@/lib/config'
<h1>{SITE_CONFIG.company.name}</h1>

// Change once = Updates everywhere ✅
```
